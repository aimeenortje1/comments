# comments
An app with components to add nested comments to a project

## Building Locally
FOr this project I used React, Vite, IndexedDB and TailwindCSS. 

- Install Dependencies `npm install`
- Run Locally `npm run dev`
- Tests `npm run test`

Enjoy adding comments to a the mock projects!

## Improvements
- adding logic for when the data should sync
- adding functionality to automatically update the comments on a new tab
- there might be some types missing
- some tests are missing
